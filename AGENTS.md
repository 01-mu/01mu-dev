# Agent Advisory (soft policy)

- This project deploys to Cloudflare when merged to `main`.
- Merge work into `dev` as the default path.
- For releases, open a `dev` -> `main` PR.
- Never merge into `main` except from `dev`, and only via a GitHub browser PR that the user approves.
- User uses `git`; Codex uses `jj`.
- Use `jj change`/`jj new` and bookmarks appropriately, and keep `jj describe` up to date.
