Writing that lasts has a pace. It does not rush to persuade; it stays with the
question long enough for the question to change its shape.

When I return to a thread after a few weeks, I notice what I forgot to keep. The
ideas I want to trust are the ones that remain legible after distance.

So I try to write in a way that leaves room for silence. A paragraph can be a
pause. A sentence can be a breath.
