<WIP>This article is still a placeholder draft.</WIP>

Writing that lasts has a pace. It does not rush to persuade; it stays with the
question long enough for the question to change its shape.

<Note>Some thoughts need a longer cadence before they read clearly.</Note>

When I return to a thread after a few weeks, I notice what I forgot to keep. The
ideas I want to trust are the ones that remain legible after distance.

<Context>
- Personal project
- Short drafts between longer posts
</Context>

So I try to write in a way that leaves room for silence. A paragraph can be a
pause. A sentence can be a breath.

<Decision title="Why steady cadence">
- Avoid forcing conclusions too early
- Keep notes readable months later
</Decision>
